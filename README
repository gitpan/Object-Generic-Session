Object-Generic-Session

A web application session object that allows access to internal
key/value pairs with an interface similar
to that of Object::Generic and Class::DBI.

Requires Apache::Session, Session.pm, and Object::Generic.
Hasn't only been tested with Apache 1.3.x.

The test suite currently does little more than see if the module loads;
the dependencies make it difficulty to run without things
like Apache servers and MySQL accounts available.

See Object::Generic's documentation for more on the general idea.
